All pictures are maed by running entropy.py and choosing options, except random_line.png,
where you also have to change the 0 to a 1 on line 19.

neighbour_100 and cell_100 are made by choosing mode 0 and 1 respectively,
with 100 seeds and 100 samples. An interesting thing is the empty band around
lambda = 0 to lamdba = 0.2. They also seem to have the same general shape
as in Langton's paper, but shoot up earlier, at around lambda=0.4. Maybe
this is because of the isotropy condition, which I didn't understand, or
some other difference.
These pictures can also be recreated by reading from the text files.

random_line and table_line are made with mode 0, and have 10 seeds and 10
lambdas. It clearly shows a difference between the methods. The table walk
entropy always goes up, while the random entropy varies wildly.

Sometimes the entropy goes down as lambda goes higher with the table walk
method, which I found strange, but the explanation is logical. A new rule causes
a previous structure to be annihilated, which in turn leads to fewer structures.
You can see this in lower and higher, which were made with k=8,r=2,
start_seed = 3 and lambda_seed  = 3. They have lambda = 0.16 and
lambda = 0.32, respectively.
